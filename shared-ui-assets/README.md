# 3J Labs Shared UI Assets

**Created**: 2026-01-03  
**Purpose**: Centralized UI System for all 3J Labs ACF CSS Plugin Family

## What's Inside

This folder contains shared CSS and JavaScript files that provide a consistent, modern UI across all 9 plugins in the 3J Labs ACF CSS Family.

### Files:
- `jj-ui-system-2026.css` - Main design system (colors, components, animations)
- `jj-ui-system-2026.js` - JavaScript utilities (modals, toasts, AJAX, validation)

### Usage:
Each plugin loads these assets from its own `assets/` folder (symlinked or copied during build).

### Benefits:
- ✅ Consistent brand identity across all plugins
- ✅ Single source of truth for UI updates
- ✅ Faster development (reusable components)
- ✅ Smaller maintenance burden

### Design Philosophy:
> "첫 눈에 쓰고 싶어지는 플러그인" - Jenny's Vision

Modern, clean, marketing-ready interfaces that make users feel confident and excited.
